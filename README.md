# Comparison-of-AB-Test-and-Conversion-of-Bidding-Methods

## Business Problem
Facebook recently introduced what's called "maximum bidding".
a new bidding type as an alternative to the bidding type
Introduced "average bidding".

The client has decided to test this new feature and wants to run an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding. The ultimate measure of success is Purchase, so for statistical testing, focus should be on the Purchase metric.

## Dataset
In this dataset, which includes the website information of a company, there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here. There are two separate data sets, the control and test groups. These datasets are in separate sheets of the ab_testing.xlsx excel. Maximum Bidding was applied to the control group and Average Bidding was applied to the test group.
